                        <p class="paragraph">
                            I am a full stack Software Engineer from Northern Indiana with experience in not only web applications, but also mobile applications and stand-alone software. I recently graduated from Taylor University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science Systems. I enjoy problem solving and working with technology, so computer science was a natural fit for me. I am currently looking for a career that challenges me, one that allows me to work with newer technologies, and learn new things.  I want to use my skills to learn how to create value in your company and find areas where I can help your company thrive. I am positive, disciplined, and innovative. I work best in environments where I solve problems by thinking critically and creatively.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="heading-tertiary u-margin-bottom-small">A little bit of my background</h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            I grew up in a rural town in Northern Indiana where I graduated from West Noble High School. I played football from 4th grade all the way through my senior year at Taylor University. While in high school I was a member of Business Professionals of America, I was in the band, I was part of the football team, and I threw shot-put for our track and field team. I have been to 9 different countries on missions trips and other various vacations. While attending Taylor University my days were filled with school and football practice, but in my free time I was also involved with many other things around campus. I was a mentor to an at-risk child at the local elementary, and was a residence hall assistant for one year. My hobbies include spending time outside, sports, lifting weights, and tinkering around with technology. I am an avid Chicago Cubs and Chicago Bears fan.

                      <p class="overlay-module__content__text">&emsp;&emsp; This project was one of my favorites to work on. This project is a barebones point of sale application. When you first enter you are taken to a home page in which you can enter the stores name that you want to go to. If you do not know a name, there will be a randomly generated name in the box to start. This will take you to the store page. At the store page you can add any of the items from that store to your order or you can log in with Github or Facebook. If you own the store or the store has no owner then you will then see the inventory section. From there you can add an item or edit any item already in the store.</p>

                        <p class="overlay-module__content__text">&emsp;&emsp;In my previous internship I had worked using React and React-Native, and did not really understand exactly what they did. This project was created during a course that I took called React For Beginners by Wes Bos. During this project I learned the basics of React such as: how to build an entire App or Website Component in React.js from start to finish, working with create-react-app for Webpack Tooling, understanding React Components and writing markup with JSX, maintain my Application's State, communication between components working with State and HTML5 LocalStorage, real time web socket data with Firebase, creating maintainable code with JavaScript Modules, URL routing with React Router 4, taking advantage of new ES6 Features, and deploying React Applications. Although all of the styling for this project was given to us before we started, we built each component ourselves and also created each of the animations.</p>

                        <p class="overlay-module__content__text">&emsp;&emsp; This is the newest project that I am working on. The idea for this project came when I was studying one day and did not know what music to listen to. I looked around and stumbled onto the Rolling Stones 500 Greates Albums of All Time list. I felt like I had just fallen onto a gold mine. One of my favorite things to do is to listen to an album all the way through, kind of like a book. So I began working my way through this list trying to listen to a couple of albums everytime I had work to do. Before long I began to lose track of what albums I had listened to and which I hadn't. This is where the idea for Rolling 500 came into play. At first I wanted the site to store all of the albums in a database and have a boolean for each album that would tell me whether or not I had listened to it yet. This way I could get on the site anytime I needed to and check off items on my list or look at where I am at. I then thought it would be cool if other people could take advantage of this app as well. So I wanted to make it so that people could log on and have their own personal version of the list that they could work through themselves. Then finally when looking around on the internet I found sites with top hip-hop albums of all time, or top albums since 2015. These lists were all something that I wanted to work through as well, so the idea come to fruition that people could create lists of albums, and then other people could subscribe to them and try and work their way through that list.</p>

                        <p class="overlay-module__content__text">&emsp;&emsp;Since I have just started working on this project, there is not much completed on it yet. All I have when you get to the site is a list of Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and each item on that list you can click, and if the album is on spotify, it will take you there. The goal for this project is for me to learn more about React in a real application that others will be using. I also want to work more with material-ui and learn more material design principles. I am very excited to continue working on this project in the future.</p>
